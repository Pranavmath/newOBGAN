My current iteration of using Synthetic data and Curriculum Learning to enhance the accuracy of a Object detection model for detecting pulmonary nodules. This iteration is different since:
- It uses diffusion model instead of PConv
- The code is a lot more optimized and faster
- Cleaner and higher quality code
- Better curriculum learning procedure
